# Registrationshop

Interactive registration tool for 3D medical datasets.

Written for the most part in Python. Uses PySide for the interface and uses VTK for the visualizations. Uses [vtkMultiVolRen](https://github.com/karlkrissian/vtkMultiVolRen) for rendering multiple datasets in one vtkRenderer. My fork can be found at [https://github.com/berendkleinhaneveld/vtkMultiVolRen](https://github.com/berendkleinhaneveld/vtkMultiVolRen). Needs to be compiled first before Registrationshop can be made to work.

For deformable registration it will use [elastix](http://elastix.isi.uu.nl).

Instructions on how to make it build and run are not available yet: once the project is in a more functional state I will make sure to create a nice guide. Or maybe even create some builds? Who knows!
